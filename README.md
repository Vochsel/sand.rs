I’ve recently gotten into a unique form of making art by simulating the placement of millions of particles of sand. The ideas stemmed from the pieces of work created by Anders Hoff [@inconvergent](https://twitter.com/inconvergent). After discovering his twitter I was really intrigued by the creation process of some of his works. I found one style of art particularly interesting and I seeked to recreate the process and discover some of the magic behind the art. The process involved drawing tiny dots over and over to build up and create patterns. By giving each dot a single formula and applying some randomness to it’s position over time a unique style of “Sand Art” is created.
